# Changelog

## Unreleased

## Version 1.5.0-beta.1 - Experimental Performance Virtualization

- Added experimental Performance Virtualization as a third long-conversation management mode
- Kept currently mounted ChatGPT turn DOM under ChatGPT/React ownership
- Added ACTIVE, WARM, and FROZEN rendering states with measured intrinsic-height preservation
- Added Navigator and Bookmark target pre-thaw behavior
- Protected recent turns and the active streaming response from intentional freezing
